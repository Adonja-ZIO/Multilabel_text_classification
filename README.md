# Multilabel Text Classification for Stack Overflow Questions

This project focuses on building a multilabel text classification system to automatically categorize Stack Overflow questions. The goal is to develop a model that can predict multiple relevant tags or labels for a given question based on its text content.

The project involves the following steps:


## Explorative Data Analysis

In the context of the multilabel text classification project for Stack Overflow questions, the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase plays a crucial role in understanding the dataset, gaining insights into the distribution of tags, exploring question lengths, and identifying patterns or relationships between tags and other variables. EDA helps in making informed decisions about feature extraction, model selection, and further analysis.

### Data Collection

Before performing EDA, it is essential to gather a dataset of Stack Overflow questions along with their corresponding tags. We collect the dataset by executing an SQL request to fetch the required data from the Stack Overflow database or using a public dataset that contains the necessary information. The dataset should be representative and diverse enough to capture the various topics and tags present in Stack Overflow.


### Data Preprocessing

Before diving into the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it is crucial to preprocess the text data to clean it and prepare it for analysis. The following typical preprocessing steps can be applied:

* Removing noise and irrelevant information:** Remove any noise or irrelevant information that may interfere with the analysis. This can include removing special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, or any specific patterns that are not relevant to the text analysis.

* Removing punctuation marks and special characters: Eliminate punctuation marks and special characters from the text data. This step helps to focus on the meaningful content of the text.

* Removing or handling HTML tags, URLs, or code snippets: If the text data contains HTML tags, URLs, or code snippets, it's essential to remove or handle them appropriately. This can be done using regular expressions or specialized libraries.

* Converting text to lowercase: Convert all the text to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity during analysis. This step helps to treat words with the same spelling but different cases as the same token.

* Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units, such as words or subwords. It helps in further analysis and feature extraction.

* Removing stop words: Remove common words, known as stop words, that do not carry significant meaning for text analysis. Examples of stop words include "the," "is," "and," or "in." Stop words can be removed using predefined lists or libraries.

* Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form to handle variations. Lemmatization aims to normalize words, such as converting "running," "runs," and "ran" to their common base form "run." This step helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and treating similar words as the same token.

By applying these preprocessing steps, the raw text data is transformed into a more manageable and consistent format, which facilitates further analysis during the EDA phase.


### Visualization

During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, the dataset is analyzed and visualized to gain insights into its characteristics and identify patterns or relationships. In the context of this project, the following key aspects can be explored during EDA:

- Distribution of Tags: Determine the frequency and distribution of different tags in the dataset. This analysis helps in understanding the label distribution and potential class imbalance. Visualizations such as bar plots or pie charts can be used to visualize the tag distribution.

- Question Lengths: Analyze the lengths of the questions in terms of word count or character count. Understanding the distribution of question lengths can provide insights into the text length variation, which can be useful for feature extraction and model design. Histograms or box plots can be used to visualize the distribution of question lengths.

- Tag Relationships: Explore the relationships between different tags. Identify frequently co-occurring tags or tag combinations. This analysis helps in understanding the associations between different topics or categories. Network graphs or co-occurrence matrices can be used to visualize tag relationships.

- Tag Correlations: Calculate tag correlations to identify any relationships or dependencies between tags. This analysis can provide insights into the co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity of certain tags. Heatmaps or correlation matrices can be used to visualize the tag correlations.

Visualization techniques such as bar plots, histograms, word clouds, tag networks, scatter plots, or heatmaps can be employed to facilitate understanding and communicate the findings effectively. These visualizations can help in identifying patterns, outliers, and potential relationships between tags, which can further inform the feature extraction and modeling process.

It is important to note that the specific techniques and visualizations used for EDA may vary depending on the nature of the dataset and the research questions or objectives of the project.


### Feature Extraction

After completing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the next step is feature extraction. Feature extraction involves transforming the preprocessed text data into numerical features that can be used as input to the classification model. Common techniques for feature extraction in text classification include:


* Bag-of-Words: The bag-of-words approach represents the text as a vector of word frequencies. It creates a vocabulary of unique words from the corpus and counts the occurrence of each word in each document. This approach ignores the order and structure of the words in the text but captures the presence or absence of specific words. The CountVectorizer is a popular implementation of the bag-of-words technique in scikit-learn.

* TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): TF-IDF represents the importance of a word in a document relative to its occurrence across all documents. It combines the term frequency (TF), which measures how frequently a word appears in a document, with the inverse document frequency (IDF), which penalizes words that occur frequently across multiple documents. TF-IDF assigns higher weights to words that are more specific to a document and less common across the entire corpus. The TfidfVectorizer in scikit-learn can be used to compute TF-IDF features.

* Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of words. Word embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText learn the vector representations by considering the context in which words appear in a large corpus of text. These embeddings can capture relationships between words and are useful for capturing semantic similarity and context in the text.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise, punctuation, stop words, and performing tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization as necessary. This step helps to prepare the text for further analysis.


## Modelling an Deployment

### Model Training

In the task of multilabel text classification, it is crucial to choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model that can effectively handle the task at hand. The selection process involves testing multiple algorithms on the prepared training data and choosing the one that performs best on the dataset. Here is an outline of the steps involved:

1. Model Evaluation: Begin by evaluating various pretrained models on the prepared training data. Pretrained models are pre-trained on large-scale text datasets and can provide a good starting point for text classification tasks. Consider models such as BERT, USE which have been trained on extensive text corpora and have demonstrated strong performance in various natural language processing tasks.

2. Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each pretrained model. Since it is a multilabel classification task, metrics such as jaccard_score, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or Hamming loss can be used. Choose metrics that are suitable for evaluating the ability of the model to predict multiple relevant tags.

3. Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different pretrained models and their optimized hyperparameter settings based on the evaluation metrics. Select the model that achieves the best performance on the multilabel text classification task.

It is worth noting that pretrained models may have different architectures and input requirements.

### Model Deployment

Once the trained model has been evaluated and deemed satisfactory, it can be deployed to a production environment for practical use. This involves setting up an infrastructure where the model can accept new Stack Overflow questions as input and provide predictions for their tags in real-time.
Deployment on AWS EC2 Instance

To deploy the model on an AWS EC2 instance, follow these steps:

- Infrastructure Setup: Create an AWS EC2 instance to host your model deployment. Choose the instance type and configuration based on your requirements.

- API Development: Develop an API using a Flask framework. This API will serve as the interface for interacting with the model.

- Deployment Steps: Perform the following actions to deploy the model on the EC2 instance:
    * Install the necessary dependencies and libraries on the EC2 instance.
    * Transfer your model files and code to the EC2 instance by cloning the GitHub repository.
    * Set up the API on the EC2 instance, ensuring it listens for incoming requests on the desired port.
    * Configure security groups and firewall settings to allow inbound traffic to the EC2 instance on the chosen port.

- Public DNS or IP Address: Once the EC2 instance is up and running, you will be provided with a public DNS or IP address. Users can access the deployed model using the following link: [Automatic categorisation of stack overflow questions](http://ec2-35-180-55-184.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:5000/) 

The API interface must appear as :
